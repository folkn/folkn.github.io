<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 20 (April 7) -&nbsp; Approximating Function with Polynomials (Series part 10/12)&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 19 (April 5) - All convergence tests (Series part 9/12)</strong></span></p>
  <p>One exam-style question on series tests. The intention today is to test your speed and accuracy, so showing work will not be as important.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 18 (March 31) - Alternating Series &amp; Ratio &amp; Root Tests (Series part 6-8/12)</strong></span></p>
<p>1.Determine the convergence and the type of convergence (absolute or conditional) for an alternating series..&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You might be asked to find the maximum error (Max Rn) in estimating the total sum.</p>
<p>2. Convergence of a series which works best with either the ratio or root test.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 17 (March 29) - Comparison Test (Series part 5/12)</strong></span></p>
<p>You are given two infinite series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use whichever method you want to determine the convergence/divergence of the series, but obviously the comparison test will help you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 16 (March 24) - Divergence &amp; Intgr Test (Series part 3-4/12)</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You will be given one infinite series.</strong> <br>You will have to use both the divergence test and integral test. I'll also ask you directly to check the three conditions for the integral test.<br><br>Review u-sub and by-parts, and don't get tripped by improper integrals.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>The Wordle was "Folks" for 5 points!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 15 (March 22) - Infinite Series (Series part 2/12)</strong></span></p>
<p>Welcome back! How was your spring break?</p>
<ol>
<li>If the given series converges, then find its infinite sum. The series will be a geometric one</li>
<li>Convert a given repeated decimal to a fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 14 (March 10)</strong></span></p>
<p>One should not have to do a tedious quiz right after exams and right before spring break.</p>
<ol>
<li>A free and thoughtful question completely unrelated to the content</li>
<li>A really simple filler calculus question that requires&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>zero</strong></span> studying.</li>
</ol>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Exam 2 Material:</strong></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 13 (March 3) - Sequences (Series part 1/12)</strong></span></p>
<p>You are given a choice of a few sequences. Pick one. Using your chosen sequence, you <em>may </em>be asked to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the <strong>explicit </strong>and/or <strong>implicit/recursive </strong>forms</li>
<li>Determine the convergence of the sequence</li>
<li>Determine several properties of the sequence which may include:<br>- increasing/decreasing<br>- nonincreasing/nondecreasing<br>- monotonicity<br>- boundedness&nbsp; (do not worry about "above" vs "below". Just whether it is bounded to an asymptote or not)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 12 (March 1)</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>You will have to determine whether an integral is convergent or divergent.</li>
<li>You can either try to compute it (using limits); or use concepts like (1) continuity of 1/x^p (2) Comparison test &lt;- it'll take you 40 seconds if you use both, but longer if you don't</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 11 (Feb 24)</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>You are asked to perform partial fraction decomposition. You will not be solving any integrals - just decompose it correctly.</li>
<li>You are given an integral to solve. The integral involves the e^x family of functions. Use <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>any</strong></span><strong> </strong>method, perhaps more than one method. An additional hint given on the quiz.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you wrote "F" on quiz 10, 5 points will be added to your cumulative quiz score</p>
<p>If the cumulative points exceed 100%, they will be saved for the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 10 (Feb 22)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><strong>Trigonometric Substitution</strong></p>
<p>Based on trig sub content taught on Feb 14 Lecture, Feb 15 Recitation, and Feb 16 Lecture</p>
<p>You will get one super simple trig sub and one that is not a perfect square. All my questions this time.</p>
<p>If you read the textbook, online, or use the integral calculator, their method is slight different than what I taught. Use whichever method you feel most comfortable with.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><small>*If you are reading this, bonus points if you write the letter "F" next to the rightmost multiple choice bubble, i.e.: 1 (A)(B)(C)(D)(E) 2 (A)(B)(C)(D)(E) F</small></p>
<p><small>*Offer void if anyone mentions this in class. Bonus point applies even if you score 10/10 (extra points will be given for another quiz).</small></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 09 (Feb 17)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Trigonometric</strong> <strong>Integrals</strong> (not trig sub)</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve an integral of the PRODUCT of two trig functions. One from: (sin^n cos^m) or (sec^n tan^m) or (csc^n cot^m)</li>
<li>Solve an integral of a trig function (that is not a product of two trig functions)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use my suggested techniques (conversion to u-sub), or use any method you wish (including guessing)</p>
<p>One will be multiple choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 08 (Feb 15)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Integration by parts only</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;<br></strong>LIATE/ILATE will work. The standard method or any shortcut methods are accepted.</p>
<p>1. Integration by parts in which you do it once.</p>
<p>2. Integration by parts where you will have to do it more than once.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; (Sounds like it will have e^x&nbsp; or a trig function)</p>
<p>Do not forget +C for indefinite integrals. Don't include +C for definite integral (with bounds)</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 07 (Feb 10)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Physical Applications using Integrals (2)</strong>&nbsp; - One question 10 points</p>
<p>The quiz will cover one of these questions. These types of problems will only contain metric units. Refer to my notes pages 1, 5-6 for relevant examples.</p>
<p><strong>1) Work required to pump water out of a&nbsp;cylindrical tank</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recall the formulas&nbsp;</strong> <br>F(x)=(density)(g)(Volume)&nbsp;<br>Work on one slice of water = (Force) (Distance from slice to exit)<br>Total Work=integral of above work.</p>
<p>For this topic, we consider normal density = mass / volume.</p>
<p><strong>2) Total force applied to the wall of a dam</strong> (<strong>due</strong> <strong>to water pressure</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Recall the formulas</strong></p>
<p>Pressure = (density)(g)(depth)<br>Force on one slice of wall = (Pressure)(Area of slice)</p>
<p>Total Force = integral of above force</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Exam 1 Material:</strong></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 06</strong></span></p>
<p>The problems are taken from the exam, and the integrals will easy enough to solve by hand (hardest would be u-substitution or factoring perfect squares).</p>
<ol>
<li>Compute the length of a curve&nbsp;<strong>(don't forget the domain of f'(x) )</strong></li>
<li>Compute the surface area of a curve revolved around the [x or y] axis</li>
<li>One application problem, which could be either:
<ol>
<li>Work done by moving a Spring; or</li>
<li>Work done by lifting a rope/chain</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 05</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>This should be easier than quiz 4.</p>
<p>You will be given a graph that resembles a rotated cone&nbsp; &nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp; y=x, y=0, x=0, x=1).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will give you the graph with the region already shaded - no need to draw.<br>You will&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">draw slices</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">set-up</span> equations for the shell and disk method. - no need to compute.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 04</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Both questions are an exact match to the examples in the recitation notes. Only the examples that we did in class - not the extra problems &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>You are asked to find the area of the region bounded by two graphs.</li>
<li>You are asked to find the volume of a solid of revolution using any method (I recommend the disk/washer 🍽️).</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 03</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are asked to find <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two </strong></span>vectors perpendicular to two given vectors. Remember that <b>u cross v</b> and its opposite, <b> v cross u = -(u cross v)</b> are both perpendicular to the two vectors.<br>(See notes pages 4-5 and the example on page 7)</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will then give you a set of points. You are then asked to find the&nbsp;<strong>area&nbsp;</strong>of either the triangle or parallelogram.<br>(See notes pages 12-14)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 02</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are given a few vectors<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You have to find four things: <strong>dot product</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>angle between them</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>scalar component, vector projection.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will have a choice of which pair of vectors to compute these things. All answers will have nice numbers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 01</strong></span></p>
<p>Two survey questions&nbsp;<strong>for 3 points</strong></p>
<p><strong>For 4 points, </strong>I give you a vector. You will do two things with it:<br>1) Find another vector with size XX which is [parallel to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> in the direction of] that given vector. See recitation notes page 12-14.</p>
<p>2) Sketch the given vector on the 3D plane. See notes page 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For 3 points - Multiple Choice, </strong>I give you a sphere in non-standard form. You will find the radius&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> center of that sphere. Hint: Use CTS.&nbsp;</p>
