    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 05</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>This should be easier than quiz 4.</p>
<p>You will be given a graph that resembles a rotated cone&nbsp; &nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp; y=x, y=0, x=0, x=1).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will give you the graph with the region already shaded - no need to draw.<br>You will&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">draw slices</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">set-up</span> equations for the shell and disk method. - no need to compute.</p>
<p></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 04</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Both questions are an exact match to the examples in the recitation notes. Only the examples that we did in class - not the extra problems &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You are asked to find the area of the region bounded by two graphs.</li>
<li>You are asked to find the volume of a solid of revolution using any method (I recommend the disk/washer üçΩÔ∏è).</li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 03</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are asked to find <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two </strong></span>vectors perpendicular to two given vectors. Remember that <b>u cross v</b> and its opposite, <b> v cross u = -(u cross v)</b>    are both perpendicular to the two vectors.<br>(See notes pages 4-5 and the example on page 7)</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will then give you a set of points. You are then asked to find the&nbsp;<strong>area&nbsp;</strong>of either the triangle or parallelogram.<br>(See notes pages 12-14)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 02</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are given a few vectors<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You have to find four things: <strong>dot product</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>angle between them</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>scalar component, vector projection.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will have a choice of which pair of vectors to compute these things. All answers will have nice numbers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiz 01</strong></span></p>
<p>Two survey questions&nbsp;<strong>for 3 points</strong></p>
<p><strong>For 4 points, </strong>I give you a vector. You will do two things with it:<br>1) Find another vector with size XX which is [parallel to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> in the direction of] that given vector. See recitation notes page 12-14.</p>
<p>2) Sketch the given vector on the 3D plane. See notes page 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For 3 points - Multiple Choice, </strong>I give you a sphere in non-standard form. You will find the radius&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> center of that sphere. Hint: Use CTS.&nbsp;</p>
