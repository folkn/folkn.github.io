<b><u><h1> Quiz 4 </h1></u></b>

<p> 1) You are given a vector-valued function, and you will have to either [compute its curvature] OR [find points that have a given curvature]. Note that the steps for both are identical except for the very last step. </p>
<p> 2) You will have to identify the shape OR the graph of the level curves given a 3D surface [i.e. a 2-variable function z=f(x,y)]. Remember that you will pick your own values of z and solve, and may involve completing the square.</p>


<small>Second bonus point for drawing <u>anything not math-related</u> on the quiz. Draw a stick figure if you have no idea or can't draw (like me). Again, points added at the end of the semester. Can mention in class.</small>

<b><u><h1> Quiz 3 </h1></u></b>

<p> 1) You are given a <b>velocity</b> and some initial conditions. You will have to find things like acceleration and/or position and/or time.</p>
</br> (You won't have to explicitly consider any "circular motion" or "projectile motion" concepts from physics. Just a general understanding of position, velocity, speed, acceleration, and time is sufficient for the quiz/exam)</br>


<p> 2) You are asked to determine either the <b> length of the curve </b> or the <b> interval given a length </b>. Note the process for both is exactly the same up to the last step.

  
</br></br> Thanks to those who participated in the favorite snack/desert challenge! Points added at the end of the semester.

<b><u><h1> Quiz 2 </h1></u></b>

<p>You will be given an equation of a surface. You may have to do one or more of the following: </p>
<p>  (1) Identify the shape and its direction  (2) Determine its center  (3)  Draw a quick sketch (no traces) </p>
<p> Be sure to know how to complete the square. </p>
</br>
<p>You *may* be given a vector-valued function. You will have the do only one the following: </p>
<p>  (1) Determine its domain  (2) Draw a quick sketch  (3) Take the limit or determine intervals of continuity </p>
</br> Review the squeeze theorem for limits of trig.

<p> </br>Bonus points for those who write their favorite snack/desert underneath the multiple choice box. If you have no idea, write "chocolate" which is my favorite thing.Offer void if anyone mentions this< in class.</p>


  <b><u> <h1> Quiz 1 </h1></u></b>

<p>Two questions, one which will be exactly an example we covered in recitation, taken from a past exam. It'll most likely be a planes question.</p>
<p> One of the questions will be a free survey </p>
