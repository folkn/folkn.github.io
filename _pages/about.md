I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** at the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), University of Berkeley, hosted by [Prof. Chunlei Liu](http://chunleiliulab.github.io/).

I completed my doctoral studies at the Schools of [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at Purdue University, supervised by Prof. Edward J. Delp and Prof. Joseph V. Rispoli.

I am the recipient of the [IEEE MTT-S Graduate Fellowship in Microwave Engineering for Medical Applications](https://mtt.org/fellowship-projects/), the [Bakar Innovation Fellowship](https://bakarfellows.berkeley.edu/) for technology commercialization efforts, and the King of Thailand Research Fellowship. 

**My research interests** spans electromagnetics, RF design, and biomedical imaging. I develop digitally controlled RF systems that remain stable and efficient even as their operating environment changes. I use these advances to build new MRI hardware, combining flexible, wearable coils with self-adjusting RF architectures that simplify operation and expand imaging capabilities.
